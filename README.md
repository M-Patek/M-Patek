## 🔬 Research Paradigm & Tech Stack

I am committed to exploring the engineering pathways for the evolution of AI agents from "static instruction followers" to "dynamic cognitive entities."

### 1. ⚛️ Recursive Meta-Optimization
* **Research Core**: Leveraging closed loops of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to achieve self-iteration of prompts and code logic.
* **Technical Depth**: Constructing behavioral guardrails based on Constitutional AI (CAI) to ensure safety and alignment during meta-level optimization processes.
* **Keywords**: Second-order Optimization, Self-Evolving Prompts, CAI Alignment.

### 2. 🧠 Heterogeneous Graph-RAG
* **Research Core**: Designing an all-dimensional perception architecture that integrates unstructured, structured, graph-based, and real-time streaming data.
* **Technical Depth**:
    * **Graph-RAG**: Implementing deep semantic relationship retrieval via Text-to-Cypher.
    * **GNN Inference**: Utilizing Graph Neural Networks to mine latent topological relationships in heterogeneous data, combined with Celery asynchronous queues for high-load inference offloading.
* **Keywords**: Vector/Graph/Temporal Fusion, GNN Inference, Knowledge Injection.

### 3. 🤖 Multi-Agent Consensus Orchestration
* **Research Core**: Designing high-order agent workstations featuring a "Perception-Introspection-Audit" closed loop.
* **Technical Depth**:
    * **Cognitive Cycle**: Simulating the continuous evolution of digital life based on Memory Consolidation mechanisms.
    * **Robust Execution**: Building an agent consensus system that includes Vigilance (monitoring), Adversary (checks), and Planner (dynamic scheduling).
* **Keywords**: Reasoning Ensemble, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), Agentic Workflow.

### 4. ⚡ AI Infrastructure & Ops
* **Research Core**: Production-grade infrastructure supporting large-scale agent operations.
* **Technical Depth**:
    * **Full-stack Observability**: Integrating Prometheus monitoring and dynamic log replay to enable visual auditing of agent Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
    * **Local Execution Core**: Developing low-latency, high-privacy, cross-platform backend execution environments.
* **Keywords**: Containerized Orchestration, Full-stack Monitoring, Async Event Bus.
